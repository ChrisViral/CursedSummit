### About

This repository is a for-fun small summer project between three friends. The goal is to make a basic, but polished game,
from A through Z, with the knowledge we already possess, and by learning new stuff and tools along the way. The game itself
will be made on the Unity 5 engine. For now there are no plans to commercially release the finished product, nor to
publish it in any sort of way, though this is subject to change depending on the quality of the final result. Comments and questions
can be directed to [Chris](mailto:christophe_savard@hotmail.ca).
